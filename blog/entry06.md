**Takeaways from giving your [Expo elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nTZDTJp862jFH8GZkgHgC-m3Q14Gdz_anv5qA_lA_kE/edit?usp=sharing)**
- Validation and Encouragement: Ms. Vierling's positive comments made me realize my project was not too shabby
- Presentation Skills and conciseness: Presenting my project to the judges enhanced my public speaking and presentation skills, all within the one-minute time frame
- Insight into Industry Standards: The judgesâ€™ expertise gave me insight into industry standards and expectations, which is valuable for future projects and career planning

**Takeaways from giving your [in-class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1twMXybXfz-r_i4byGJ35BKJ65K0lwfaIveimNTXGgns/edit?usp=sharing)**

Creating my first "official" project for my Minecraft mod throughout AP Computer Science A (APCSA) was a unique and enjoyable experience. The project showed me that there was more to Java than just one runner file and maybe an occasional class file. It showed that APCSA was only the beginning, a very oversimplified and condensed segment on what Java actually is. The experience of navigating through various files and folders, along with figuring out what foreign code meant highlighted what actual coding felt like, not just some random Project Stem assignment, which is something I will hold onto for the rest of my life.

**Skills**
The project also helped me develop my collaboration and time management skills
- For collaboration, I worked with one of my friends Alex Xiao, who gave me the models/textures for the Ruby, Ruby Ore, and Pearl items. Being able to offload a little bit of the workload allowed me to hone in on other aspects of the Freedom Projects, such as implementation. 
- In terms of time management, as I reflect on the last couple of months, I think my time management was a bit iffy. With college applications in the Fall (I applied to 20+) to studying for AP exams, time for the Freedom Project was hard to figure out. To combat this, I started to set aside ~1 hour every Sunday to work on the project and update my learning log (if needed). 

**Engineering Design Process (EDP)**
Currently, I am on the Improve and Coordinate stade of the EDP.
- Improve: I have identified some bugs in the mod. Specifically, the block-breaking mechanics on the added blocks.
- Coordinate: I presented my project to the class and at the expo. Additionally, the project is communicated via the blogs in this folder.
