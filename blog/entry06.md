Takeaways from giving your Expo elevator pitch
Takeaways from giving your in-class presentation
First “official” project
Not bad, was kind of fun
Helped develop collaboration
Even though this was solo, one of my friends created the art for the items
Seeing Java applied in a game
Very different from learning it in class
Showed that this class is just an oversimplified summary of what Java actually is
