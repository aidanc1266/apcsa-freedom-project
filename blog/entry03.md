What happened
A lot of things happened over the past couple months. First, I added a few new items
- Ruby

- Block of Sapphire
- Block of Raw Sapphire

The reason for adding these new materials is to make some infused armor/tools stronger and more durable.
To create these items, I used the same method described in [Blog 2](https://github.com/aidanc1266/apcsa-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry02.md).
However, blocks are implemented differently. Here is what I did to create the `Block of Sapphire` and `Block of Raw Sapphire`. I learned how to do this using this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_VO6tD6Y1g).


what's next
Add the Block of Ruby and Pearl.
Learn how to create armor, tools, and weapons.
Learn how to create crafting recipies using the materials.
Now that college applications are over, more will be done in a shorter amount of time.
