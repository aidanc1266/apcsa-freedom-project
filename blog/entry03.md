What happened
Added two new items using this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Xbp2dTEGA):
- Ruby
- Pearl
_add images later_
The reason for adding these new materials is to make some sort of infused armor/tools to make them stronger and more durable.

The Block of Sapphire and Block of Raw Sapphire was also added with the assistance of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_VO6tD6Y1g)
_add images later_

what's next
Add the Block of Ruby and Pearl.
Learn how to create armor, tools, and weapons.
Learn how to create crafting recipies using the materials.
Now that college applications are over, more will be done in a shorter amount of time.
