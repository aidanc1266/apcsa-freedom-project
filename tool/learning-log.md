10/29/23:
* Installing IDE and Minecraft modding plugins [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRDrWYpgliY)
* The video is slightly outdated and the GUI is a bit off, but the same buttons are there, just in different places
* The plugins put in loads of code already for the game so I need to figure out where I start

11/5/23:
* Remade my IDE, realized there was something wrong and ran into a dead end, used another [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55qUIf3GMss)
* This guide will direct me on how to make specific things in Minecraft (items, textures, etc)

11/13/23
* Created a [Github Repo](https://github.com/aidanc1266/aidanmcmod-freedomproject) that is connected with my project on the IDE

11/27/23
* watched the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Xbp2dTEGA) on how to make custom items
* one of my friends outside of HSTAT might make the art/textures for the item, will ask Mr. Mueller if this is legal

12/10/23
* Added test items to Minecraft using the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Xbp2dTEGA)
  * Created the Sapphire and Raw Sapphire items and textures in-game
  * Created the Creative Mode Tab menu specifically for the Sapphire items
  * Pushed everything onto the [repo](https://github.com/aidanc1266/aidanmcmod-freedomproject/tree/master/src/main)
* Next week will be on creating custom blocks using this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_VO6tD6Y1g)

12/17/23
* Watched the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_VO6tD6Y1g) on how to create the block in-game
* Gathered the jpeg of the `Raw Sapphire Block` and `Sapphire Block`

* Will implement them in-game over the break

1/1/24
* Decided to postpone learning how to implement the blocks until next week because of college applications, AP Chem notes, and Quality of Life paper being due at the same time
* Instead, I have created two items
 * Ruby ![ruby](https://github.com/aidanc1266/apcsa-freedom-project/assets/145048443/151f5673-3522-429b-866b-31f052161a8a)
