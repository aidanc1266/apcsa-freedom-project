10/29/23:
* Installing IDE and Minecraft modding plugins [video]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRDrWYpgliY))
* The video is slightly outdated and the GUI is a bit off, but the same buttons are there, just in different places
* The plugins put in loads of code already for the game so I need to figure out where I start

11/5/23:
* Remade my IDE, realized there was something wrong and used another guide (insert video later)
* This guide will direct me on how to make specific things in Minecraft (items, textures, etc)

11/13/23
* Created a [Github Repo](https://github.com/aidanc1266/aidanmcmod-freedomproject) that is connected with my project on the IDE
