# APCSA Freedom Project
by **Aidan Cheiban**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in [AP Computer Science A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a). The "Freedom Project," developed by the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/), is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Java** in order to help me make a **Minecraft Mod**.
